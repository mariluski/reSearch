# reSearch, the search engine

currently on develop so not much to see here yet, but you can test it or contribute to it if you want.

### Dev note
reSearch is a search engine that I am building, it will be a self-hosted alternative to Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and other search engines. It will be built with Rust
