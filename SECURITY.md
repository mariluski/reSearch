## Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a security report, we will:

2. Audit code to find any similar issues.
3. Develop and test a fix.
4. Prepare a security advisory and release patched versions.
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability 7 days after releasing the patch, unless otherwise agreed with the reporter.

### If the issue has already been exploited:
6. We will immediately initiate our "Handling of Exploited Vulnerabilities" process.  
7. A public statement will be issued, detailing the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, and steps users should take to protect themselves.

## Handling of Exploited Vulnerabilities

If a vulnerability has already been exploited:

1. We will initiate a "safe mode" for affected versions, disabling certain features to mitigate risk.
2. Downloads of affected versions will be temporarily disabled.
3. We will expedite the fix and release process.
4. Once fixed, we will re-enable downloads and provide a guide for affected users to address any potential impacts.
